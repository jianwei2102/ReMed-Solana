* Main features
A decentralized permission based EMR management system for healthcare providers and patients.
1. Enhanced Data Security
Centralized EMR systems are vulnerable to breaches and unauthorized access. Our platform leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized ledger of medical records. This ensures that patient data is securely stored and immutable, greatly reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized alterations.

2. Improved Privacy Control
Patients have limited control over their data in traditional systems. With our solution, patients retain complete control over who can access their records through a permission-based model managed by smart contracts. This empowers patients to grant or revoke access as they see fit, safeguarding their privacy and enhancing their sense of security.
